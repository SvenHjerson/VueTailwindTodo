# Vue with Tailwind Todo App

A rough Vue todo app using Tailwind when learning Vue with Erik's Vue360 course

See [Demo](https://vue-tailwind-todo-example.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify.

The first go already uses some computed properties, but it still needs a bit of refactoring to move stuff to separate components, perhaps add some routes ... maybe use local storage etc.

## Project setup ... as per usual

```
npm install
```

### and then of course the usual serve and build commands

```
npm run serve / build
```
